# Server-Client
A simple python script that allows me to send a message from a client computer to a server host


In the client.py file do note that you need to change the ip to the server machines ipv4, to do this over the internet and not your local network is something
i am working on

Next i plan to make a gui for the client side of the program allowing for a cleaner look on it
Server will stay as the cmd window (windows) with it printing out messages

When the server recives a message from a client it will play a sound, "ping" will play a ping sound when inputed, next "Anything" (anything being any string except the one stated 
before) will play any sound
